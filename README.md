# Usage
Enter the desired red, green, and blue values in the input fields. The values should range from 0 to 255.

The hex color code will be automatically generated and displayed in the square box.

Optionally, you can use the color picker input to select a color visually. The red, green, and blue values will be updated accordingly, and the hex color code and square box will be updated as well.
